## Salary Estimation Project

### Overview
The Salary Estimation project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating salaries based on employees' position levels. This predictive model facilitates understanding the correlation between position levels and salaries, enabling organizations to make informed decisions regarding their salary structures.

### Project Structure

#### 1. Data Loading
The dataset named `Position_Salaries.csv` is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. This dataset comprises two columns: "Position Level" and "Salary". Pandas' `read_csv()` function is used for loading the CSV file, enabling easy data exploration and manipulation.

#### 2. Data Preparation
- Independent (X) and dependent (y) variables are isolated from the dataset.
- Reshaping of the position level data (X) into a 2D array is performed to ensure compatibility with the SVR model.

#### 3. SVR Model Selection
- SVR (Support Vector Regression), a variant of Support Vector Machines tailored for regression tasks, is selected for modeling.
- The SVR model is instantiated with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, chosen for handling nonlinear relationships.

#### 4. Feature Scaling
- Both the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (y) undergo Min-Max scaling, transforming the features to a range between 0 and 1. This enhances the convergence rate and model performance.
- Scikit-learn's `MinMaxScaler` is employed for scaling.

#### 5. Model Training and Prediction
- The SVR model is trained using the scaled feature set (X) and target variable (y).
- Predictions are made using the trained SVR model to estimate salaries based on position levels.

#### 6. Inverse Transformation
- Predicted salary values are inverse-transformed back to their original scale using the `inverse_transform()` method. This ensures that the predicted salary values remain interpretable and aligned with the original dataset.

#### 7. Visualization
- Matplotlib is utilized to create visualizations illustrating the relationship between position levels and salaries.
- Original data points are plotted as a scatter plot, while the SVR-generated regression line is superimposed to demonstrate the model's fitting performance.

### Next Steps
- Further exploration of alternative regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
- Optimization of model parameters and evaluation of additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Summary
The Salary Estimation project demonstrates the application of SVR for predicting salaries based on position levels. By following stages such as data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization, the project develops a predictive model and offers insights into salary structures based on position levels.
